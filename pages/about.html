                Hi! I'm Alexander Winslow Robinson Bean (he/him). There is plenty to know about me,
                which I hope I'll be able to go over here in no particular order.
            </p>
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                I am a long time gamer, I played my first video game -- Final Fantasy IX 
                for the PS1 -- when I was five. Saying I "played" it, though, might be
                a bit of an exaggeration; I'd mostly make my dad run around in the overworld
                until he got into a random encounter and then I would take over. I enjoyed
                the fighting, while the actual random encounter screen swirl of the time
                would always startle me. My love for Final Fantasy has continued, however, 
                as I regularly play FFXIV and I try to play every new mainline Final Fantasy 
                release.<br>
                Aside from Final Fantasy, I have a decently wide range of games that I enjoy.
                Here's a small sampler of games that I've played recently that I'd recommend:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Final Fantasy XIV (obviously)</li>
                    <li>Street Fighter 6</li>
                    <li>Soulash 2</li>
                    <li>Songs of Syx</li>
                    <li>Albion Online</li>
                    <li>Century: Age of Ashes</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                There are plenty of others that I've played that I would certainly recommend,
                but the list would end up taking the entire page. Maybe I'll make a separate
                page  dedicated to video game reviews.
            </p>            
            <h3>Programming & Computers</h3>
            <p>
                This one is probably pretty apparent within the small web community that any
                given person likely has some interest in programming or computers, so I'll try
                to keep it brief.<br>
                I started out my interest in computers hand-in-hand with video gaming earlier
                in my life. I don't remember how I originally got them, but I would play my
                copies of Age of Empires, Rome: Total War, and Neverwinter Nights on the family
                Dell when I lived in Las Vegas.<br>
                This would snowball into further interests in PC gaming and thusly the computer
                itself. Living now in California, my dad would offer for my birthday to help me
                choose parts for and build my first custom computer. The most I remember about
                my original build is that it had an AMD CPU and GPU since they were cheaper at
                the time, and I barely helped build it because it confused me. I took that
                build with me through our future moves and, if I remember correctly, is a bit
                of a Ship of Theseus to my current PC build now.<br>
                Interest in computers blossomed into an interest in programming, encouraged
                by my dad once again. I took every programming class in high school that I
                could, learning Java, C++, HTML, CSS, a bit of game development with GameMaker,
                probably a couple others as well. That interest carried through into college
                at the Oregon Institute of Technology where I started out as a CS major, but
                then moved to Embedded System Engineering Technology after my first year,
                preferring the idea of working with microcontrollers and other small 
                electronics.<br>
                Today, I work as a Controls Engineer in automation. My job is done one part
                in front of the computer, designing logic for factory automation, and one
                part on the floor of various plants and factories commissioning and testing.
                Honestly, while I do enjoy the work sometimes, I could do without the travel
                that is required, as I'm more of a homebody than anything, plus when I travel,
                it's never really to anywhere interesting. I'm on the lookout for other jobs
                that would sit me at home more often!
            </p>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                The cliche thing to say is that I "listen to everything", but I do feel like
                I've found bits of any genre that I'm able to appreciate in one form or
                another. Some of my favorite artists include any of the following:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steely Dan</li>
                    <li>Porter Robinson</li>
                    <li>100 gecs</li>
                    <li>Good Kid</li>
                    <li>Foo Fighters</li>
                    <li>Femtanyl</li>
                    <li>Gustav Holst</li>
                    <li>underscores</li>
                    <li>Jakey</li>
                    <li>Madeon</li>
                    <li>Jacob Collier</li>
                    <li>Alex Unknown</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                And plenty more besides that. I do also come across random music from
                disparate genres that I'll give my attention, though, even if I don't
                follow the artist.
